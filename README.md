=======

Some scripts &amp; config I often use.

## Scripts

### iTerm2-startup.scpt

Contains a script that configures my iTerm2 windows, tabs, and split-panes. It also names the tabs accordingly and starts up the processes needed to run my development projects locally.

### photoshop-export-layers-as-pngs

Contains a script (SaveLayers.jsx) for exporting layers in a Photoshop document to PNGs. Additional documentation is available [here](http://www.github.com/jenwilhelm/scripty/config/photoshop-export-layers-as-pngs/README.md).

## Config

### .bash_profile

Contains a few commonly used aliases, as well as color functionality for differentiating my git branch from the rest of my command line. 


### .gitconfig

Contains some shortcuts to make working with Git on the command line a little faster.
