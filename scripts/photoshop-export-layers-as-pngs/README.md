Photoshop Export Layers as PNGs
=======

## Description

Saves each layer in the active document as a PNG. If a folder or layer starts with an asterisk (*), the child layers will be saved as separate images. If a folder does not start with an asterisk, the child layers will be saved as a single combined image. If a layer or a folder starts with a pound symbol (#), that layer or folder will be ignored. The resulting PNGs will be saved in the same directory that your PSD resides in.
